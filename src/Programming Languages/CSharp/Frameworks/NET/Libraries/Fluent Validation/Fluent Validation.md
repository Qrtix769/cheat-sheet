Fluent validation is one way of setting up dedicated validator objects, which you would use when you want to treat validation logic as separate from business logic. The aspect-oriented programming (AOP) paradigm enables separation of cross-cutting concerns within a system, and validation is one such concern. Separating validation helps clean up your domain code and make it more cohesive, as well as giving you a single place to look for validation logic.
